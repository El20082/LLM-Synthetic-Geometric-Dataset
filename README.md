# LLM-Synthetic-Geometric-Dataset
In this research project, I develop an innovative algorithm to create synthetic polygon geometric shape datasets, and define methods to integrate synthetic geometric images and metadata into major LLMs for training, validation, and evaluation of their geometric reasoning abilities.
